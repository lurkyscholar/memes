Something very embarrassing (that Iâ€™m also sometimes proud of) is the fact that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bhs_memes_/?hl=en" target="_blank">I started a meme page</a>
 in high school. 
It did not come from a place of wanting to make fun of anybody. 
It came from a place of wanting to understand and communicate with my community from my perspective as an inside-outsider.
I saw the social media sphere which nebulously orbited our high school as an ever-shifting artifact of our collective consciousness, self consciousness, pretentious, presumptions, and follies. 
I found the people around me enrapturing and incomprehensible. 
At the time, I took the meme-as-medium very seriously, and sought to make the people around me intelligible through this project. 
The account gained a thousand followers overnight. I built a notorious and self-sustaining online ecosystem. People like to look at their own reflection. 
After the first three posts, all of the memes were generated and sent in by the community. 
After a week, I distributed the login information to carefully chosen representatives from each grade. 
After three weeks, I was locked out of the account.

 a testament to my own curiosity and to the enduring unintelligibility of the teenage population of Berkeley High School.
